# Stack Game (Pygame Recreation)

A recreation of the classic **Stack** game using **Pygame**. The objective is to stack blocks as accurately as possible to build the highest tower!

## Installation

```sh
pip install pygame
pip install numpy
```

## How to Play

1. Run the game using:
   ```sh
   python stack_game.py
   ```
2. Press the **spacebar** or **mouse click** to stop the moving block.
3. Stack blocks precisely to avoid reducing the platform size.
4. Continue stacking to reach the highest score!
5. Game ends when the block becomes too small to continue.
